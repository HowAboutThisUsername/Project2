		<p>Emmanuel Church was founded in 1934 in an attempt to reach more communities and to set up a more personal church
		for Paramount.</p>
		<p>Since its founding it has accomplished many things in its attempt to spread its message to Love Thy Neighbor.
		With many local projects it has not only cleaned up its community but it also improved and helped build it up stronger than before</p>
		<p>When asked whether or not the church accomplished its goals it is said that although the did indeed do a lot
		the lords work never ends and so Neither will the church's goal. We will continue to serve and spread love for as
		long as the church stands</p>

		<p>Our Current Pastor Bill Patterson has been working with the church for 15 years as its pastor and has been attending since his youth.
		When aksed did he ever think about another career he responded <blockquote>While I was also young and reckless at times I new in my heart that I belonged tot the church and would one day work there</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>With three kids and two already pursuing similar careers Bill is fully commited 
		to the church and spreading the word of god in his communities. Bill treats his community the same as
		his family and he strives everyday to make sure his family reaches it's max potential
